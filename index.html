<h1>G'day Udacity!</h1>
<p>My name is <strong>Leah Hovig</strong> and I'm a new student of Udacity on my way to earn my Front-End Web Development Nanodegree.
</p>
<p>"Hello World!" I'm originally born and raised in Melbourne, Australia now currently living in the US. I work full time for CBS as a Webmaster  and also a tech blogger reviewing new innovative products. Reason why I signed up here on Udacity is to improve my skills and become better programming</p>
<p>I'm hoping with my full schedule I can make the time to learn and earn my degree. <strong>Crossing my fingers!</strong>  </p>
  <p>Thank you in advance to Udacity and their teachers for taking time to give us a chance to learn online and to improve our skills. </p>
  <p>I can be reached by email <a href="mailto:lchovig@gmail.com">lchovig@gmail.com</a> or you can <strong>ping</strong> me on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/LeahHovig">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Shinyotaku">Twitter</a>, or <a href="https://instagram.com/shinyotaku/">Instagram</a>.  </p>
  <p>Thank you
<h2>PS... Happy St. Paddy's Day!</h2>
